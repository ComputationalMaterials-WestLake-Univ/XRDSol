The AutoMapper is a equivariant diffusion model to solve crystalline structures by iteratively refining atom coordinates from powder XRD. XRDSol has solved thousands of entries that were previously unresolved or unlabeled. Compared to prior methods, the solving efficiency of XRDSol (0.6 seconds per solution) is more than 104â€’105 times. Furthermore, we have addressed critical challenges in crystal structure solutions, such as light-element materials, natural minerals, and disordered structures. Additionally, XRDSol has corrected 39 long-standing unplausible crystal structures from the past several decades. 

Its main functionalities:

- correctly solve the crystal structures from PXRD.
- identify the incorrect crystal structure solutions.
- solve the disordered materials by "ordered approximations".
